main:
Read from file into listof strings (lines)
Read lines and get sum

lines, running_total = 0, symbolhash_top = empty, numstocheck_top = empty -> sum:
- idx counter, numsearch, symbolsearch
- iterate through characters
- if number, keep save begin idx, keep going until number ends, end idx, search for symbol
- if symbol, add symbol to symbolhash_curr, search for number, if next character period, reset
- if symbol after number
